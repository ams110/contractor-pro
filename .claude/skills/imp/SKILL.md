description: >
  Improve and optimize any prompt before executing it. Use this skill whenever the user writes a prompt, request, or task for Claude and wants it enhanced before execution. Triggers on phrases like "improve this prompt", "enhance my prompt", "optimize this request", "حسّن البرومت", "طوّر الطلب", or any variation where the user wants their input refined using prompt engineering best practices before Claude acts on it. Also trigger when the user says "imp" followed by a prompt, or wraps their request with intent to get a better version. This skill should trigger even if the user casually says things like "make this prompt better and run it", "imp this", or "حسّنه ونفذه". The final output is always: the improved prompt shown to the user, followed by the result of executing it.

# IMP — Prompt Improver & Executor

This skill takes any user prompt, improves it using prompt engineering best practices, then executes the improved version and returns both the enhanced prompt and the result.

## How It Works

When triggered, follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Analyze the Original Prompt

Read the user's prompt carefully and identify:
- What is the user trying to achieve?
- What's missing or vague?
- What format/structure would improve the output?
- What context could be added?

### Step 2: Improve the Prompt

Apply these prompt engineering techniques (pick the ones that fit — don't force all of them):

**Clarity & Specificity**
- Replace vague language with precise instructions
- Add specific output format requirements if missing
- Define constraints (length, style, audience, etc.)

**Structure**
- Use XML tags to separate instructions, context, and input when the prompt has multiple parts
- Break complex tasks into numbered steps if order matters
- A well-chosen role can sharpen the output, and you're often better at phrasing it than the user — but NEVER inject or override a role silently. When a role would help, PROPOSE 1–2 concrete role options and ASK the user to pick one (or approve yours) before you finalize the improved prompt. Example question: «أي دور بتفضّل أعطيه لكلود؟ ١) مطوّر واجهات senior  ٢) مستشار منتج — أو اكتب دورك.»
- If the user already gave their own framing (e.g. "you are the app owner" / "أنت مالك التطبيق"), keep it as the default — never silently replace it with a narrower expert role. You MAY offer a sharper phrasing and let the user choose, but only lock in the role the user picked or approved.

**Context & Motivation**
- Add the "why" behind the request — this helps Claude understand the goal and generalize
- Include audience or use-case context when relevant

**Examples**
- Add 1-2 brief examples if the desired output format isn't obvious
- Use `<example>` tags to wrap them

**Thinking & Verification**
- For complex reasoning tasks, ask Claude to think step-by-step
- For tasks with verifiable answers, add a self-check instruction

**Output Control**
- Specify format (prose, list, table, code, JSON, etc.)
- Set length expectations if important
- Request the response in a specific language if the user's prompt implies one

> **Role check:** if a role assignment would meaningfully help, don't decide it alone — propose 1–2 options and ask the user to pick (see the role rule above) before finalizing.

### Step 3: Present the Improved Prompt

Show the improved prompt to the user in a clear, labeled block. Use this format:

```
✨ البرومت المحسّن / Improved Prompt:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[the improved prompt here]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Keep the language of the improved prompt matching the user's original language. If the user wrote in Arabic, improve in Arabic. If in English, improve in English.

### Step 4: Wait for Approval, Then Execute

Do NOT execute automatically. After presenting the improved prompt, STOP and ask the user to confirm before running it — e.g. «نفّذها زي ما هي؟ أو بدّك تعدّل عليها؟». Only execute after the user agrees.

**The one exception:** if the user's original message already told you to run it too (e.g. "حسّنه ونفّذه", "imp this and run it", "make it better and execute"), skip the question and execute directly.

When you do execute, show the result clearly:

```
📋 النتيجة / Result:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[the result of executing the improved prompt]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Important Guidelines

- The improvement should be meaningful, not just cosmetic. If the original prompt is already excellent, say so and execute it as-is.
- Don't over-engineer simple prompts. A short request like "translate this to French" doesn't need XML tags and role assignment — just minor refinements.
- Match the complexity of the improvement to the complexity of the task.
- Preserve the user's intent exactly. Never change what they're asking for — only improve how they're asking for it.
- When a role would improve the prompt, suggest it and ask the user to choose — don't impose one silently. Never replace the user's own framing without asking first.
- Default to NOT auto-running. Show the improved prompt, then wait for the user's go-ahead — unless they explicitly asked you to run it in the same message.
- If the prompt references uploaded files, images, or context from the conversation, make sure the improved prompt preserves those references.
- If other skills are more appropriate for the execution step (e.g., docx, xlsx, pptx, pdf), use them during execution.

## Examples

**Example 1: Simple prompt**

Original: "اكتبلي إيميل اعتذار"

Improved:
```
أنت كاتب محترف متخصص في التواصل المهني.

اكتب إيميل اعتذار رسمي وقصير (لا يزيد عن 150 كلمة) بالعربية الفصحى. الإيميل يجب أن:
- يبدأ بالاعتذار المباشر
- يوضح الإجراء التصحيحي
- ينتهي بنبرة إيجابية

اكتب الإيميل مع سطر الموضوع.
```

**Example 2: Complex prompt**

Original: "Help me build a landing page for my SaaS product"

Improved:
```
You are a senior frontend developer and UI/UX designer.

Create a modern, conversion-optimized landing page for a SaaS product. Include:

<requirements>
1. Hero section with a compelling headline, subheadline, and CTA button
2. Features section (3-4 key features with icons)
3. Social proof section (testimonials or stats)
4. Pricing section with at least 2 tiers
5. FAQ section
6. Footer with links
</requirements>

<design_guidelines>
- Use a unique, non-generic color palette — avoid default purple/blue gradients
- Choose distinctive typography (not Inter, Roboto, or Arial)
- Add subtle animations for scroll reveals
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Dark/light theme toggle
</design_guidelines>

Build this as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. Make it production-ready and visually distinctive.
